    // action - the very first time it's needed. An anonymous FirebaseUser
    // still has a real, stable uid (it persists across app restarts once
    // created - Firebase writes it to local storage - so this only
    // actually calls the network once per install, not once per launch),
    // which is all currentUserUidOrNull()/isSignedIn() below, and every
    // caller of them (VideoCallActivity, VideoCallListenerService,
    // AshuDialerApp.watchVideoCallingAvailability), ever actually needed -

    // to key signaling documents by. The optional Google Sign-In flow
    // below is left fully intact for anyone who wants a recognizable name
    // on their account/backup - it simply upgrades the same
    // FirebaseAuth session (linkWithCredential preserves the existing
    // anonymous uid rather than swapping to a new one, so any in-flight
    // calls or state keyed by uid aren't disrupted by signing in for real
    // partway through the app's lifetime).

    // Failure here (no network, Firebase misconfigured, Anonymous
    // provider disabled in the Firebase console) is deliberately silent

    // it already did before this existed, and every other part of the
