 * one more call to a method that already exists.

 * Kept as its own repository rather than folded into CallInsightsRepository:
 * insights aggregates ONE period: reconnect suggestions compare TWO
 * (a "history" window against a "recent" window), which is a different
 * enough shape to justify not overloading CallInsights' single-period data
 * class with two-period fields only this feature would ever populate.
