 * The correct video state to answer() an incoming call with, shared by
 * every answer path across this Activity (notification-tap auto-answer,
 * and the ringing screen's own Accept button - PixelInCallService.answer()
 * has its own equivalent for the third path, the notification's action
 * button, since it doesn't share this file's scope).
 *
 * See PixelInCallService.answer()'s doc comment for the full reasoning -
 * in short: this only ever answers as STATE_BIDIRECTIONAL when the
 * incoming call itself already requested video (a real VoLTE video call),
 * preserving STATE_AUDIO_ONLY for every ordinary voice call exactly as
 * before. VideoProfile.isAudioOnly(int) is used rather than a plain ==
 * comparison against STATE_AUDIO_ONLY (which is 0, so == would miss any
 * state that also has the paused bit set) per the platform's own
 * documented guidance for this check.
